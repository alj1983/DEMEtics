Description: Allows to calculate the fixation index Gst
  (Nei, 1973) and the differentiation index D (Jost, 2008) pairwise
  between or averaged over several populations.  P-values, stating the
  significance of differentiation, and 95 percent confidence intervals
  can be estimated using bootstrap resamplings. In the case that more
  than two populations are compared pairwise, the p-values are
  adjusted by bonferroni correction and in several other ways due to
  the multiple comparison from one data set.
