## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have fixed a bug that
resulted in wrong confidence interval calculations. 

## Test environments
* ubuntu 16.04, R 3.2.3

## R CMD check results

* There were 3 NOTES

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Gst (4:12, 10:53)
  Jost (11:48)
  Nei (11:4)
  bonferroni (16:15)
  resamplings (14:36)

All words are spelled correctly.
